    "Consider a gambler in a casino who has the option to pull one of several slot machines. The gambler must decide which machine to pull at each iteration in order to maximize some reward. Each machine provides a random reward from some (unknown) probability distribution specific to that machine. The objective is to maximize the total reward from a sequence of lever pulls of the slot machines. An agent simultaneously tries to acquire new knowledge (\"exploration\") whilst at the same time optimizing their decisions based on existing knowledge. The problem requires balancing reward maximization based on the knowledge already acquired with attempting new actions to further increase knowledge.

However this can result in being stuck in suboptimal bandits, for example if only one of the bandits returns a sale in the first iteration, it will always have a higher MLE estimate for the conversion rate than the other bandits. Epsilon-Greedy alters this 'greedy' approach by having a small probability of choosing a bandit at random, $\\epsilon$. The controls the amount of exploration- a higher value of $\\epsilon$ is associated with a greater amount of exploration of different bandits but a lower level of exploitation by assigning the optimal bandit (advert) to each user.  We can also introduce a __cooling schedule__, whereby the value of $\\epsilon$ (level of exploration) decreases at each iteration, enabling us to exploit the optimal bandit as we collect more data and hence become more confident in our estimates of net conversion for each bandit. The value of epsilon therefore decays over time, decreasing as the amount of data gathered increases. \n",

Our prior knowledge and intuition suggests that we want a cooling schedule that declines fast enough to exploit the best performing bandit but one that isn't so fast to decline that it fails to explore the bandit and potentially select a sub-optimal bandit. This will require some tuning- we also expect that the more bandits we have and the smaller the gaps in true probabilities, the slower epsilon should decline, since we require more time to explore the bandits in order to identify and then exploit the optimal bandit.
